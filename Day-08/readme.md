## Assignment: Exploring CSS: Styles, Comments, and Selectors

### Objective

This assignment will help you to get familiarized with the three methods of incorporating CSS into an HTML document: inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS. You'll also delve into CSS comments and selectors.

### Requirements

1. **Create a Basic HTML File:** Construct an HTML file with the following elements:

- A header tag with the text "Welcome to My Webpage!"
- Two paragraph tags with some text of your choice.
- An unordered list with three list items.

1. **Implement Inline CSS:** Add inline CSS to change the color of the text in the header tag.

2. **Implement Internal CSS:** Use internal CSS to change the color of the text in the paragraph tags.

3. **Implement External CSS:** Create an external CSS file and link it to your HTML file. Change the color of the text in the list items using the external CSS file.

4. **Use CSS Comments:** Include comments in your CSS code, explaining what each block of CSS does.

5. **Use CSS Selectors:** Use element, class, and ID selectors in your CSS to apply the color changes to your HTML elements.

### Submission**:**

1. An HTML file.
2. A CSS file.
