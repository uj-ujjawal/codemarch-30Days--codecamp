## Assignment: Create a Portfolio Webpage

### Objective

Create a portfolio webpage using HTML that demonstrates your understanding of semantic elements, `<!DOCTYPE>`, viewport meta tag, embedding a PDF, and the dir attribute.

### Requirements

1. Create an HTML file named "portfolio.html".
2. Start your HTML document with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.
3. Include the necessary HTML tags to define the structure of the document, such as the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
4. Inside the `<head>` tag, add a `<title>` tag to give your webpage a title, such as "My Portfolio".
5. Also in the `<head>` tag, include the viewport meta tag to ensure your webpage is responsive on different devices.
6. Use semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<aside>` to structure your webpage.
7. Include the following elements in your webpage:
    - A navigation bar using the `<nav>` tag.
    - A main section that includes a brief introduction about yourself and your work using the `<section>` and `<article>` tags.
    - An aside section that includes a list of your skills or services using the `<aside>` tag.
    - A footer that includes your contact information using the `<footer>` tag.
8. Embed a PDF file into your webpage using the `<embed>` tag. This could be a resume, a project report, or any other relevant document.
9. Use the `dir` attribute in a paragraph of text to demonstrate its usage. This could be a paragraph written in a right-to-left script like Arabic or Hebrew, or a paragraph where you want to change the text direction for emphasis or design purposes.
10. Use proper indentation and formatting to make your HTML code easily readable.
11. Save your HTML file and open it in a web browser to see your portfolio webpage.

### Submission

Submit the "portfolio.html" file containing your portfolio webpage. Ensure that your code follows the assignment requirements and demonstrates your understanding of semantic elements, `<!DOCTYPE>`, viewport meta tag, embedding a PDF, and the dir attribute.
