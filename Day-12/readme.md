## Assignment: FontXpress

### Objective

The objective of this assignment is to practice applying CSS properties related to font styling, units of measurement, cursor property, and the !important rule to create a visually appealing webpage.

### Requirements

1. Create an HTML file named "index.html" with the following structure:
    - Add a header element with a heading of your choice.
    - Create a paragraph element with some text content.
    - Use Icons of your choice.

2. Apply CSS properties to style the text and other elements according to the following requirements:

    Font Styling:

    - Set the font family of the heading to a modern font of your choice.
    - Adjust the font size of the paragraph text to make it easily readable.
    - Set the font weight of the heading to create emphasis.

    Units of Measurement:

    - Use relative units of measurement (e.g., em, rem) for font size and margin properties to ensure scalability and responsiveness.

    Cursor Property:

    - Change the cursor property for the paragraph text to a pointer to provide visual feedback when hovering over it.

    !important Rule:

    - Use the !important rule to override a previously defined CSS property for a specific element to achieve the desired visual effect. Apply it to the font size of the paragraph text.

3. Use appropriate CSS properties, units, and techniques to create a visually appealing webpage.
